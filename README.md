## Notes

1. [[1]] Modulo operations, although we see them as  
$O(1)$ , are a lot slower than simpler operations like addition, subtraction or bitwise operations.

1. [[2]] A linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.

1. [[2]] For $ax + by = c$ a degenerate case is when $a = b = 0$. Depending on wh
